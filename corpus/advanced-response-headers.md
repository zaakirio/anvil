# Response Headers

## Use a `Response` parameter

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function* (as you can do for cookies).

And then you can set headers in that *temporary* response object.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/headers-and-object/")
def get_headers(response: Response):
    response.headers["X-Cat-Dog"] = "alone in the world"
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporary* response to extract the headers (also cookies and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set headers (and cookies) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly

You can also add headers when you return a `Response` directly.

Create a response as described in [Return a Response Directly](response-directly.md) and pass the headers as an additional parameter:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/headers/")
def get_headers():
    content = {"message": "Hello World"}
    headers = {"X-Cat-Dog": "alone in the world", "Content-Language": "en-US"}
    return JSONResponse(content=content, headers=headers)
```

**Note: Technical Details**

You could also use `from starlette.responses import Response` or `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

And as the `Response` can be used frequently to set headers and cookies, **FastAPI** also provides it at `fastapi.Response`.


## Custom Headers

Keep in mind that custom proprietary headers can be added [using the `X-` prefix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

But if you have custom headers that you want a client in a browser to be able to see, you need to add them to your CORS configurations (read more in [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](../tutorial/cors.md)), using the parameter `expose_headers` documented in [Starlette's CORS docs](https://www.starlette.dev/middleware/#corsmiddleware).
