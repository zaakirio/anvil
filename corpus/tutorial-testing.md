# Testing

Thanks to [Starlette](https://www.starlette.dev/testclient/), testing **FastAPI** applications is easy and enjoyable.

It is based on [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org), which in turn is designed based on Requests, so it's very familiar and intuitive.

With it, you can use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) directly with **FastAPI**.

## Using `TestClient`

**Note**

To use `TestClient`, first install [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org).

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md), activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install httpx
```


Import `TestClient`.

Create a `TestClient` by passing your **FastAPI** application to it.

Create functions with a name that starts with `test_` (this is a standard `pytest` convention).

Use the `TestClient` object the same way as you do with `httpx`.

Write simple `assert` statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard `pytest`).

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_main():
    return {"msg": "Hello World"}


client = TestClient(app)


def test_read_main():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"msg": "Hello World"}
```

**Tip**

Notice that the testing functions are normal `def`, not `async def`.

And the calls to the client are also normal calls, not using `await`.

This allows you to use `pytest` directly without complications.


**Note: Technical Details**

You could also use `from starlette.testclient import TestClient`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.testclient` as `fastapi.testclient` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.


**Tip**

If you want to call `async` functions in your tests apart from sending requests to your FastAPI application (e.g. asynchronous database functions), have a look at the [Async Tests](../advanced/async-tests.md) in the advanced tutorial.


## Separating tests

In a real application, you probably would have your tests in a different file.

And your **FastAPI** application might also be composed of several files/modules, etc.

### **FastAPI** app file

Let's say you have a file structure as described in [Bigger Applications](bigger-applications.md):

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py
```

In the file `main.py` you have your **FastAPI** app:


```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_main():
    return {"msg": "Hello World"}
```

### Testing file

Then you could have a file `test_main.py` with your tests. It could live on the same Python package (the same directory with a `__init__.py` file):

``` hl_lines="5"
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Because this file is in the same package, you can use relative imports to import the object `app` from the `main` module (`main.py`):

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from .main import app

client = TestClient(app)


def test_read_main():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"msg": "Hello World"}
```


...and have the code for the tests just like before.

## Testing: extended example

Now let's extend this example and add more details to see how to test different parts.

### Extended **FastAPI** app file

Let's continue with the same file structure as before:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Let's say that now the file `main.py` with your **FastAPI** app has some other **path operations**.

It has a `GET` operation that could return an error.

It has a `POST` operation that could return several errors.

Both *path operations* require an `X-Token` header.

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

fake_secret_token = "coneofsilence"

fake_db = {
    "foo": {"id": "foo", "title": "Foo", "description": "There goes my hero"},
    "bar": {"id": "bar", "title": "Bar", "description": "The bartenders"},
}

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    id: str
    title: str
    description: str | None = None


@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def read_main(item_id: str, x_token: Annotated[str, Header()]):
    if x_token != fake_secret_token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid X-Token header")
    if item_id not in fake_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return fake_db[item_id]


@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item, x_token: Annotated[str, Header()]) -> Item:
    if x_token != fake_secret_token:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid X-Token header")
    if item.id in fake_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=409, detail="Item already exists")
    fake_db[item.id] = item.model_dump()
    return item
```

### Extended testing file

You could then update `test_main.py` with the extended tests:

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from .main import app

client = TestClient(app)


def test_read_item():
    response = client.get("/items/foo", headers={"X-Token": "coneofsilence"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {
        "id": "foo",
        "title": "Foo",
        "description": "There goes my hero",
    }


def test_read_item_bad_token():
    response = client.get("/items/foo", headers={"X-Token": "hailhydra"})
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Invalid X-Token header"}


def test_read_nonexistent_item():
    response = client.get("/items/baz", headers={"X-Token": "coneofsilence"})
    assert response.status_code == 404
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item not found"}


def test_create_item():
    response = client.post(
        "/items/",
        headers={"X-Token": "coneofsilence"},
        json={"id": "foobar", "title": "Foo Bar", "description": "The Foo Barters"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {
        "id": "foobar",
        "title": "Foo Bar",
        "description": "The Foo Barters",
    }


def test_create_item_bad_token():
    response = client.post(
        "/items/",
        headers={"X-Token": "hailhydra"},
        json={"id": "bazz", "title": "Bazz", "description": "Drop the bazz"},
    )
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Invalid X-Token header"}


def test_create_existing_item():
    response = client.post(
        "/items/",
        headers={"X-Token": "coneofsilence"},
        json={
            "id": "foo",
            "title": "The Foo ID Stealers",
            "description": "There goes my stealer",
        },
    )
    assert response.status_code == 409
    assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item already exists"}
```


Whenever you need the client to pass information in the request and you don't know how to, you can search (Google) how to do it in `httpx`, or even how to do it with `requests`, as HTTPX's design is based on Requests' design.

Then you just do the same in your tests.

E.g.:

* To pass a *path* or *query* parameter, add it to the URL itself.
* To pass a JSON body, pass a Python object (e.g. a `dict`) to the parameter `json`.
* If you need to send *Form Data* instead of JSON, use the `data` parameter instead.
* To pass *headers*, use a `dict` in the `headers` parameter.
* For *cookies*, a `dict` in the `cookies` parameter.

For more information about how to pass data to the backend (using `httpx` or the `TestClient`) check the [HTTPX documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org).

**Note**

Note that the `TestClient` receives data that can be converted to JSON, not Pydantic models.

If you have a Pydantic model in your test and you want to send its data to the application during testing, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` described in [JSON Compatible Encoder](encoder.md).


## Run it

After that, you just need to install `pytest`.

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md), activate it, and then install it, for example:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pytest

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will detect the files and tests automatically, execute them, and report the results back to you.

Run the tests with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pytest
