# Including WSGI - Flask, Django, others

You can mount WSGI applications as you saw with [Sub Applications - Mounts](sub-applications.md), [Behind a Proxy](behind-a-proxy.md).

For that, you can use the `WSGIMiddleware` and use it to wrap your WSGI application, for example, Flask, Django, etc.

## Using `WSGIMiddleware`

**Note**

This requires installing `a2wsgi` for example with `pip install a2wsgi`.


You need to import `WSGIMiddleware` from `a2wsgi`.

Then wrap the WSGI (e.g. Flask) app with the middleware.

And then mount that under a path.

```python
from a2wsgi import WSGIMiddleware
from fastapi import FastAPI
from flask import Flask, request
from markupsafe import escape

flask_app = Flask(__name__)


@flask_app.route("/")
def flask_main():
    name = request.args.get("name", "World")
    return f"Hello, {escape(name)} from Flask!"


app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/v2")
def read_main():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}


app.mount("/v1", WSGIMiddleware(flask_app))
```

**Note**

Previously, it was recommended to use `WSGIMiddleware` from `fastapi.middleware.wsgi`, but it is now deprecated.

It's advised to use the `a2wsgi` package instead. The usage remains the same.

Just ensure that you have the `a2wsgi` package installed and import `WSGIMiddleware` correctly from `a2wsgi`.


## Check it

Now, every request under the path `/v1/` will be handled by the Flask application.

And the rest will be handled by **FastAPI**.

If you run it and go to [http://localhost:8000/v1/](http://localhost:8000/v1/) you will see the response from Flask:

```txt
Hello, World from Flask!
```

And if you go to [http://localhost:8000/v2](http://localhost:8000/v2) you will see the response from FastAPI:

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hello World"
}
```
