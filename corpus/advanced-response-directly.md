# Return a Response Directly

When you create a **FastAPI** *path operation* you can normally return any data from it: a `dict`, a `list`, a Pydantic model, a database model, etc.

If you declare a [Response Model](../tutorial/response-model.md) FastAPI will use it to serialize the data to JSON, using Pydantic.

If you don't declare a response model, FastAPI will use the `jsonable_encoder` explained in [JSON Compatible Encoder](../tutorial/encoder.md) and put it in a `JSONResponse`.

You could also create a `JSONResponse` directly and return it.

**Tip**

You will normally have much better performance using a [Response Model](../tutorial/response-model.md) than returning a `JSONResponse` directly, as that way it serializes the data using Pydantic, in Rust.


## Return a `Response`

You can return a `Response` or any sub-class of it.

**Note**

`JSONResponse` itself is a sub-class of `Response`.


And when you return a `Response`, **FastAPI** will pass it directly.

It won't do any data conversion with Pydantic models, it won't convert the contents to any type, etc.

This gives you a lot of **flexibility**. You can return any data type, override any data declaration or validation, etc.

It also gives you a lot of **responsibility**. You have to make sure that the data you return is correct, in the correct format, that it can be serialized, etc.

## Using the `jsonable_encoder` in a `Response`

Because **FastAPI** doesn't make any changes to a `Response` you return, you have to make sure its contents are ready for it.

For example, you cannot put a Pydantic model in a `JSONResponse` without first converting it to a `dict` with all the data types (like `datetime`, `UUID`, etc) converted to JSON-compatible types.

For those cases, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` to convert your data before passing it to a response:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Item(BaseModel):
    title: str
    timestamp: datetime
    description: str | None = None


app = FastAPI()


@app.put("/items/{id}")
def update_item(id: str, item: Item):
    json_compatible_item_data = jsonable_encoder(item)
    return JSONResponse(content=json_compatible_item_data)
```

**Note: Technical Details**

You could also use `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.


## Returning a custom `Response`

The example above shows all the parts you need, but it's not very useful yet, as you could have just returned the `item` directly, and **FastAPI** would put it in a `JSONResponse` for you, converting it to a `dict`, etc. All that by default.

Now, let's see how you could use that to return a custom response.

Let's say that you want to return an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) response.

You could put your XML content in a string, put that in a `Response`, and return it:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/legacy/")
def get_legacy_data():
    data = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
    <shampoo>
    <Header>
        Apply shampoo here.
    </Header>
    <Body>
        You'll have to use soap here.
    </Body>
    </shampoo>
    """
    return Response(content=data, media_type="application/xml")
```

## How a Response Model Works

When you declare a [Response Model - Return Type](../tutorial/response-model.md) in a path operation, **FastAPI** will use it to serialize the data to JSON, using Pydantic.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item) -> Item:
    return item


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items() -> list[Item]:
    return [
        Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0),
        Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0),
    ]
```

As that will happen on the Rust side, the performance will be much better than if it was done with regular Python and the `JSONResponse` class.

When using a `response_model` or return type, FastAPI won't use the `jsonable_encoder` to convert the data (which would be slower) nor the `JSONResponse` class.

Instead it takes the JSON bytes generated with Pydantic using the response model (or return type) and returns a `Response` with the right media type for JSON directly (`application/json`).

## Notes

When you return a `Response` directly its data is not validated, converted (serialized), or documented automatically.

But you can still document it as described in [Additional Responses in OpenAPI](additional-responses.md).

You can see in later sections how to use/declare these custom `Response`s while still having automatic data conversion, documentation, etc.
