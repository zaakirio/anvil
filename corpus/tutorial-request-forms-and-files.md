# Request Forms and Files

You can define files and form fields at the same time using `File` and `Form`.

**Note**

To receive uploaded files and/or form data, first install [`python-multipart`](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart).

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../virtual-environments.md), activate it, and then install it, for example:

```console
$ pip install python-multipart
```


## Import `File` and `Form`

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(
    file: Annotated[bytes, File()],
    fileb: Annotated[UploadFile, File()],
    token: Annotated[str, Form()],
):
    return {
        "file_size": len(file),
        "token": token,
        "fileb_content_type": fileb.content_type,
    }
```

## Define `File` and `Form` parameters

Create file and form parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Query`:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(
    file: Annotated[bytes, File()],
    fileb: Annotated[UploadFile, File()],
    token: Annotated[str, Form()],
):
    return {
        "file_size": len(file),
        "token": token,
        "fileb_content_type": fileb.content_type,
    }
```

The files and form fields will be uploaded as form data and you will receive the files and form fields.

And you can declare some of the files as `bytes` and some as `UploadFile`.

**Warning**

You can declare multiple `File` and `Form` parameters in a *path operation*, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json`.

This is not a limitation of **FastAPI**, it's part of the HTTP protocol.


## Recap

Use `File` and `Form` together when you need to receive data and files in the same request.
